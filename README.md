# Tetris

Implementation of a Multiplayer Tetris game Implemented in C++. The game UI was implemented using `ncurses`, network connectivity with Berkley Sockets and Multithreading using the C++ `<thread>` library (less pain than raw pthreads).

Tbh the project was a bit rushed but the code might be usefull for future students.
